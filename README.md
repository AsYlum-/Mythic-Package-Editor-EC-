# Mythic-Package-Editor-EC-
UOP editor compatible with EC client of Ultilma Online

The tool works for reading UOP files and extract AND edit the content correctly.

The next objective is:

- Determine file names: while it works (more or less) if you know the exact name, it would be best to find a way to automatically find the file names. 
I've added a button to parse the file names inside a folder (and sub-folder) to the ones inside the uop, but it doesn't seem to be effective...
For some reason some file names are not recognized (even if you know exactly its name).

- Clean the code and comment properly.

If you have any idea on how to fix/improve the tool, feel free to contact me on discord: Pinco#5969
