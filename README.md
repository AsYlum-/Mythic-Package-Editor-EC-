# Mythic-Package-Editor-EC-
UOP editor compatible with EC client of Ultilma Online

The tool works for reading UOP files and extract the content correctly.

Unfortunately what is not working is:

- Save uop files: the saved files have something missing (open any uop file and save it and you'll see it). What's missing? can it be fixed?

- Determine file names: while it works (more or less) if you know the exact name, it would be best to find a way to automatically find the file names. 
I've added a button to parse the file names inside a folder (and sub-folder) to the ones inside the uop, but it doesn't seem to be effective...
For some reason some file name is not recognized (even if you know exactly its name).


If you have any idea on how to fix/improve the tool, feel free to contact me on discord: Pinco#5969
